5. Proxy Reachable:     ~2-5s
```

### 3. Response Time Distribution

| Percentile | Response Time |
|------------|---------------|
| Min        | 0.109s        |
| P50        | 0.127s        |
| P75        | 0.160s        |
| P95        | 0.463s        |
| P99        | 3.810s        |
| Max        | 6.229s        |

**Cold Start Impact:**
- First request after auto-stop: 3-6 seconds
- Warm requests: 100-200ms
- Database connection maintained during active periods

### 4. Log Analysis Summary

**Reviewed 100+ log entries across monitoring period**

#### Positive Observations:
- ✓ No database connection errors
- ✓ No application crashes or exceptions
- ✓ Successful health checks throughout
- ✓ Clean shutdown signals (SIGINT) during auto-stop
- ✓ Firecracker VM initialization successful every time
- ✓ SSH listening enabled for debugging access
- ✓ Nginx proxy operating correctly

#### Warning-Level Events:
- ⚠ Health checks temporarily in 'warning' state during startup (expected)
- ⚠ Health check failures during first 3 seconds of startup (expected behavior)
- ⚠ "Permission denied" on nginx.pid unlink (cosmetic, non-critical)
- ⚠ One instance of "[PM11] machine was recently stopped" (auto-scaling transition)

#### Error-Level Events:
- Health check failures during machine startup (0-3 seconds only)
- These are transient and resolve within 10-14 seconds
- NOT indicative of application health issues

### 5. Database Performance

**Database Connection Status:**
```json
{
  "services": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "sentry": "not configured"
  }
}
```

**Observations:**
- Database connections established successfully on every machine start
- Zero connection timeout errors
- Zero query errors in logs
- Database status reported as "healthy" in 100% of health checks
- Connection pooling appears to be working correctly

**Database Query Performance:**
- Unable to extract specific query times from application logs
- Health endpoint responds in 100-200ms (includes DB query)
- This suggests database queries are well under 100ms
- **Estimated DB query time: <100ms** (well under 500ms target)

### 6. Auto-Scaling Behavior Analysis

**Fly.io Auto-Stop Pattern:**
```
1. Machine becomes active on request
2. Handles traffic while active
3. After ~6-7 minutes of inactivity: auto-stop triggered
4. Machine gracefully shuts down (SIGINT)
5. Next request triggers machine wake-up
6. 3-6 second cold start delay
```

**Impact Assessment:**
- Expected behavior for Fly.io's scale-to-zero configuration
- Appropriate for current traffic levels (development/testing)
- Production consideration: May want always-on instance for sub-second response

**Recommendation:**
- For production, consider `min_machines_running = 1` in fly.toml
- This ensures at least one machine is always warm
- Eliminates cold start latency for user-facing requests

## Identified Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues
**NONE IDENTIFIED** ✓

### Warning-Level Issues

#### 1. Cold Start Latency
**Impact:** Low (development), Medium (production)
**Severity:** Warning

**Description:**
Machines auto-stop after 6-7 minutes of inactivity, causing 3-6 second delay on next request.

**Recommendations:**
1. **For Production:** Set `min_machines_running = 1` in fly.toml
2. **For Cost Optimization:** Keep current setup for staging/dev
3. **For High Availability:** Consider `min_machines_running = 2` with load balancing
4. **Alternative:** Implement health check ping to keep one machine warm

**Configuration Example:**
```toml
[http_service]
  internal_port = 5000
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = true
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 1  # Add this line
  processes = ["app"]
```

#### 2. Query Performance Observability Gap
**Impact:** Low
**Severity:** Information

**Description:**
Unable to measure individual database query performance from logs.

**Recommendations:**
1. Add query performance logging in application code
2. Implement OpenTelemetry tracing with database instrumentation
3. Consider pg_stat_statements for PostgreSQL query analysis
4. Add slow query logging (queries >100ms)

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
// Add to database query wrapper
const startTime = Date.now();
const result = await db.query(sql, params);
const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
if (duration > 100) {
  logger.warn('Slow query detected', { duration, sql: sql.substring(0, 100) });
}
```

#### 3. Sentry Not Configured
**Impact:** Low (development), Medium (production)

Machines: 2 × shared-cpu-1x (256MB RAM)
- Running cost: ~$3.50/month per machine when active
- Stopped cost: $0/month (scale-to-zero benefit)
- Current usage pattern: ~20% uptime (due to auto-stop)
- Estimated cost: ~$1.40/month total

Database:
- Need to verify current database configuration
- Likely using Fly Postgres or external provider

Total Estimated: $5-15/month (development tier)
```

**Production Configuration Cost Impact:**
```
min_machines_running = 1:
- One machine always running: $3.50/month
- Second machine on-demand: ~$0.70/month (20% uptime)
- Total: $4.20/month for compute

min_machines_running = 2:
- Two machines always running: $7.00/month
- Better availability and zero cold starts
- Recommended for production
```

### Cost vs. Performance Tradeoff
