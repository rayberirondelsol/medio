# SC-009 Load Test - Quick Summary

## Test Result: FAIL (But Read Below!)

**Date:** 2025-10-17 13:49:31

## What Happened

Executed 10 concurrent login attempts:
- **4 succeeded** (40%)
- **6 failed with HTTP 429** (rate limited)

## Why It Failed

The backend has **intentional security rate limiting**:
- Max 5 auth requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Each login = 2 requests (CSRF + login)
- 10 logins = 20 requests
- Result: First ~2 logins succeed, rest are rate-limited

## Performance (for successful requests)

- Average: 661 ms
- Range: 566 - 1,696 ms
- No server errors
- No degradation
- Rate limiting works correctly

## The Real Question

**This is a POLICY decision, not a performance issue.**

Do we want to:

### Option A: Keep Strong Security (RECOMMENDED)
- Accept that rate limiting blocks 10 concurrent logins
- Revise SC-009 to test 2-3 concurrent logins
- Validate that rate limiting returns proper 429 errors
- **Status: System works as designed for security**

### Option B: Relax Security for More Concurrency
- Increase rate limit from 5 to 25 requests per 15 min
- Allow 10 concurrent logins
- Reduces brute force protection
- **Status: Makes test pass but weakens security**

## My Recommendation

**Redefine SC-009:**

Old: "System handles 10 concurrent user login attempts without degradation"

New: "System handles 3 concurrent user login attempts within 2s AND properly rate-limits excessive attempts with HTTP 429"

This tests:
1. Performance under realistic load (3 users)
2. Security controls work (rate limiting)
3. Error handling is fast
4. No server degradation

## Current Backend Performance

**VERDICT: HEALTHY**

- Handles concurrent requests well
- Response times acceptable
- No crashes or errors
- Security controls working
- Rate limiting is fast and correct

## Next Steps

1. **DECIDE:** Keep strong security or relax for test?
2. **IF** keeping security → Revise SC-009 criteria
3. **IF** relaxing security → Update rate limit config

---

**Quick Answer:** The backend is performing well. The "failure" is actually security working correctly. Recommend revising the test criteria to match production security requirements.
