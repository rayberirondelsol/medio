# Specification Quality Checklist: Add Video via Link

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Completed**: 2025-10-17

All checklist items have been validated and pass:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses on WHAT users need (add videos via URL) and WHY (curate safe content for children) without specifying HOW (no React components, API endpoints, or code structure mentioned in requirements).

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all assumptions documented in Assumptions section
   - All 38 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
   - Success criteria use measurable metrics (30 seconds, 2 seconds, 95% accuracy, zero silent failures)
   - Edge cases comprehensively cover error scenarios

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - User scenarios follow priority order (P1-P4) with independent test descriptions
   - Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format for all flows
   - Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "under 30 seconds", "95% accuracy")
   - Scope is bounded to Phase 1: free/public videos only

**Ready for next phase**: This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.tasks`.

## Constitution Alignment Check

This feature aligns with Medio's constitution:

- ✅ **Child Safety First**: Age rating assignment required, parental approval for all content
- ✅ **Context-Driven Architecture**: No state management implementation details in spec
- ✅ **Test-First Development**: Success criteria and acceptance scenarios provide testable requirements for TDD workflow
- ✅ **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling requirements (FR-015 through FR-022)
- ✅ **Docker-First Development**: No environment-specific requirements; works in Docker
- ✅ **NFC Security**: Out of scope for this feature (video management, not playback/sessions)
