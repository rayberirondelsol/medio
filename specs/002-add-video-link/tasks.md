# Tasks: Add Video via Link

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-add-video-link/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Per Constitution Principle III (Test-First Development - NON-NEGOTIABLE), tests are MANDATORY for all features. Tests MUST be written first, reviewed, and approved before implementation begins. Minimum 80% code coverage required.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Backend**: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`
- Paths shown below follow existing Medio project structure

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 utilities but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Adds error handling to US1+US2 flows but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Provides fallback for US1+US2+US3 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD red-green-refactor)
- Utilities/helpers before services
- Services before endpoints
- Backend endpoints before frontend integration
- Core implementation before edge case handling
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (Phase 1)**:
- Tasks T001-T005 can all run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

**Foundational Phase (Phase 2)**:
- Tasks T007-T013 can all run in parallel after T006 completes
- T006 (GET /api/platforms) should complete first as it's needed for testing

**User Story 1 Tests**:
- Tasks T014-T019 can all run in parallel (different test files)
- T020 (E2E) should run after unit/integration tests pass

**User Story 1 Implementation**:
- Tasks T021-T022 can run in parallel (frontend utilities)
- T023-T024 can run in parallel (backend services)
- T025-T031 should run sequentially (all modify AddVideoModal)

**User Story 2 Tests**:
- Tasks T032-T039 can all run in parallel (different test files)
- T040-T041 (E2E) should run after unit/integration tests pass

**User Story 2 Implementation**:
- Tasks T042-T047 can all run in parallel (extend utilities)
- Tasks T048-T049 can run in parallel (backend services)
- T050-T052 should run sequentially (modify existing files)

**User Story 3 Tests**:
- Tasks T053-T057 can all run in parallel (different test files)
- T058-T060 (E2E) should run after unit/integration tests pass

**User Story 3 Implementation**:
- Tasks T062-T064 can run in parallel (add Sentry to services)
- T065-T072 should run sequentially (all modify AddVideoModal or related files)

**User Story 4 Tests**:
- Tasks T073-T074 can run in parallel
- T075-T076 (E2E) should run after unit/integration tests pass

**Polish Phase (Phase 7)**:
- Tasks T081-T087 can all run in parallel (different files, independent checks)
- T088-T090 should run sequentially (validation and review)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (after writing them):
Task: "Unit test for YouTube URL parsing in frontend/tests/unit/utils/urlParser.test.ts"
Task: "Unit test for YouTube platform detection in frontend/tests/unit/utils/platformDetector.test.ts"
Task: "Unit test for YouTube service API client in backend/tests/unit/services/youtubeService.test.js"
Task: "Integration test for GET /api/videos/metadata?platform=youtube in backend/tests/integration/videoMetadata.test.js"
Task: "Integration test for POST /api/videos with YouTube video in backend/tests/integration/videos.test.js"
Task: "Integration test for GET /api/platforms in backend/tests/integration/platforms.test.js"

# After tests fail (red), launch utility implementations together:
Task: "Create URL parser utility for YouTube formats in frontend/src/utils/urlParser.ts"
Task: "Create platform detector utility in frontend/src/utils/platformDetector.ts"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (database migrations, environment setup)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (GET /api/platforms, base error boundary, platform service)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (YouTube only with auto-fetch)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Can add YouTube video with URL paste
   - Metadata auto-fills within 2 seconds
   - Video appears in library after save
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation**: Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Platform endpoints ready
2. **MVP**: Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (YouTube videos working!)
3. **Multi-Platform**: Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Vimeo + Dailymotion working!)
4. **Error Resilience**: Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Graceful errors, duplicates handled)
5. **Fallback**: Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Manual entry always works)
6. **Polish**: Complete Phase 7 ‚Üí Production ready

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (YouTube auto-fetch)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Multi-platform support)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Error handling)
   - **Developer D**: User Story 4 (Manual fallback)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team completes Polish phase together

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD CRITICAL**: Verify tests fail (red) before implementing (green), then refactor
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Constitution Compliance**: 80% test coverage mandatory, Context API only, Docker-first, Error Boundaries required
- **API Keys**: YOUTUBE_API_KEY must stay in backend environment, never expose to frontend
- **Platform UUIDs**: Always fetch from GET /api/platforms, never hardcode
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 8 tasks
- **Phase 3 (User Story 1)**: 18 tasks (7 tests + 11 implementation)
- **Phase 4 (User Story 2)**: 21 tasks (10 tests + 11 implementation)
- **Phase 5 (User Story 3)**: 20 tasks (8 tests + 12 implementation)
- **Phase 6 (User Story 4)**: 8 tasks (4 tests + 4 implementation)
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 10 tasks
- **TOTAL**: 90 tasks

**Test Coverage**: 29 test tasks + 61 implementation tasks = 32% of tasks are tests (exceeds typical 20-30% ratio for comprehensive TDD)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 45+ tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**MVP Scope** (Phases 1-3): 31 tasks - Estimated 2-3 days for experienced developer following TDD workflow

**Full Feature** (All phases): 90 tasks - Estimated 5-7 days as noted in quickstart.md
