# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Video Modal Deployment and Functionality

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

The specification is ready for the next phase. No issues identified during validation.

### Detailed Validation Notes

**Content Quality**:
- Spec successfully avoids implementation details while describing deployment caching and error handling
- Focuses on user outcomes (parents adding videos, developers deploying) rather than technical solutions
- Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (resolved through informed assumptions)
- All 17 functional requirements are testable (e.g., "AddVideoModal MUST initialize platforms state as empty array")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (100% crash prevention, 60 seconds for code updates, 95% success rate)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not technical implementation ("Users can open modal" vs "React renders component")
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format with clear conditions
- Edge cases cover critical failure modes (caching, API failures, deployment timing)
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds the feature
- Assumptions and Dependencies sections provide context

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- Three prioritized user stories cover: core functionality (P1), error handling (P2), deployment (P3)
- Success criteria verify the outcomes described in user scenarios
- No leaked implementation details (nginx, React, Fly.io are in Dependencies/Assumptions, not requirements)

## Next Steps

Proceed to one of:
- `/speckit.clarify` - If you need to ask clarification questions (not needed - no markers)
- `/speckit.plan` - To generate implementation planning artifacts
