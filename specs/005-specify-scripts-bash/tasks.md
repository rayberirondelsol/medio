# Tasks: NFC Chip Registration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-specify-scripts-bash/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Per Constitution Principle III (Test-First Development - NON-NEGOTIABLE), tests are MANDATORY for all features. Tests MUST be written first, reviewed, and approved before implementation begins. Minimum 80% code coverage required.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Backend tests: `backend/src/routes/__tests__/`
- Frontend tests: `src/components/__tests__/`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and verification of existing infrastructure

- [ ] T001 Verify database schema has nfc_chips table with UNIQUE constraint on chip_uid (backend/src/db/migrate.js)
- [ ] T002 [P] Verify existing validateNFCUID() and normalizeNFCUID() functions in backend/src/routes/nfc.js
- [ ] T003 [P] Verify GET /api/nfc/chips endpoint is functional (backend/src/routes/nfc.js:49)
- [ ] T004 [P] Install express-rate-limit if not present (backend/package.json)
- [ ] T005 [P] Verify Sentry configuration in backend and frontend

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T006 Create rate limiting configuration for NFC endpoints in backend/src/middleware/rateLimiter.js (10 POST, 20 DELETE, 60 GET per 15 min)
- [ ] T007 Implement DELETE /api/nfc/chips/:chipId endpoint in backend/src/routes/nfc.js with ownership verification
- [ ] T008 Add chip count validation middleware to enforce 20 chip limit in backend/src/middleware/chipLimitValidator.js
- [ ] T009 Update backend validators to accept 8-20 hex characters (not just 14) in backend/src/routes/nfc.js
- [ ] T010 [P] Create NFCChipContext provider for React state management in frontend/src/contexts/NFCChipContext.tsx
- [ ] T011 [P] Create NFCChipErrorBoundary component in frontend/src/components/common/NFCChipErrorBoundary.tsx

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Chip-Verwaltung (Priority: P3)

- [ ] T066 [US3] Add loading state during deletion
- [ ] T067 [US3] Add error handling for deletion failures (404, 500)

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: End-to-End Testing & Integration

**Purpose**: Comprehensive E2E tests for all user workflows

- [ ] T068 [P] E2E test: Complete manual registration workflow (login ‚Üí navigate ‚Üí fill form ‚Üí submit ‚Üí verify list) in tests/e2e/nfc-chip-registration.spec.js
- [ ] T069 [P] E2E test: Duplicate chip registration blocked with error message in tests/e2e/nfc-chip-registration.spec.js

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T077 [P] Update API documentation with new rate limits and error codes in docs/api/nfc-endpoints.md
- [ ] T078 Code review and refactoring for consistency across all NFC components
- [ ] T079 Accessibility audit (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader support)
- [ ] T080 [P] Verify 80% code coverage requirement met (Constitution mandate) via npm run test:coverage
- [ ] T081 Security review (timing attack mitigation, UID enumeration prevention)
- [ ] T082 Performance testing (POST <2s, GET <1s, DELETE <2s)
- [ ] T083 Run quickstart.md validation workflow

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **E2E Testing (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 form but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses ChipList from US1 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD red-green-refactor)
- Backend tests before backend implementation
- Frontend tests before frontend implementation
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup verification tasks (T001-T005) can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within Phase 2
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- All E2E tests (T068-T075) can run in parallel
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (verify existing infrastructure)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (manual registration)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Manual Registration)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (NFC Scan)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Chip Management)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Backend already has 80% of infrastructure (UNIQUE constraints, CASCADE deletion, basic validation)
- Focus implementation effort on: DELETE endpoint, chip count limit, rate limiting, frontend components, Web NFC integration
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
