# Specification Quality Checklist: Same-Origin Authentication

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - Spec focuses on authentication behavior, not specific technologies. No mention of Express, http-proxy-middleware, Node.js in requirements or success criteria.

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - All user stories emphasize parent experience and child safety. Success criteria are user-focused ("Users can complete registration without errors") not system-focused ("API returns 200").

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - Language is accessible (e.g., "session persistence" not "JWT refresh token flow"). Technical concepts are explained in context (e.g., "15 minutes for access tokens, 7 days for refresh tokens").

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - User Scenarios & Testing ✓, Requirements ✓, Success Criteria ✓, plus optional sections (Assumptions, Constraints, Dependencies, Risks, Out of Scope) for completeness.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found. All ambiguities were resolved with documented assumptions (e.g., Assumption 1-6).

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - Each FR has clear acceptance criteria. Examples:
    - FR-001: "maintain authentication across ALL API requests" (testable: make multiple API calls, check for 401s)
    - FR-002: "MUST NOT return 401" (testable: verify response codes)
    - FR-008: "automatically refresh tokens" (testable: wait 14 minutes, make request, verify no re-auth required)

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - All SC items have specific metrics:
    - SC-001: "0% occurrence of 401 errors"
    - SC-002: "100% success rate"
    - SC-004: "15 minutes" and "7 days" (exact durations)
    - SC-007: "100 concurrent users"

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - No mention of Express, cookies, proxies, or specific technologies in success criteria. All focus on user-observable outcomes:
    - "Users can complete registration" (not "Express routes return 200")
    - "Navigate between pages" (not "Proxy forwards requests correctly")
    - "Platform handles 100 concurrent users" (not "Node.js cluster scales to 100 connections")

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - Each of 3 user stories has 4 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format. Total: 12 detailed scenarios covering registration, login, navigation, NFC workflow, multi-tab, token refresh.

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - 6 edge cases documented:
    - Session expiration during form submission
    - Network interruptions
    - Multiple tab authentication
    - Cross-browser session isolation
    - Development vs production parity
    - Token refresh failure

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists 10 non-goals (OAuth2, MFA, custom domain, localStorage tokens, session management UI, etc.).

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS -
    - 6 assumptions documented (backend cookie support, CORS config, HTTPS, browser support, etc.)
    - 5 dependencies documented (backend deployment, CORS update, build process, HTTPS certs, E2E testing)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - Each FR (FR-001 through FR-010) is actionable and verifiable through acceptance scenarios or testing procedures.

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - 3 prioritized stories (P1: Registration/Login, P2: NFC Workflow, P3: Extended Navigation) cover all critical authentication paths.

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - All 7 success criteria directly align with functional requirements and user stories. Clear mapping:
    - SC-001 → FR-001, FR-002 (no 401 errors after login)
    - SC-002 → FR-003 (multi-step workflows complete)
    - SC-003 → FR-007 (session persistence)
    - SC-004 → FR-008 (automatic refresh)
    - SC-005 → FR-005 (environment parity)

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - While Assumptions section references existing files (`backend/src/routes/auth.js`) for context, the requirements themselves remain technology-agnostic. This is acceptable as these are validation assumptions, not requirements.

## Constitution Compliance

- [x] Aligns with project constitution principles
  - **Validation**: ✅ PASS - "Constitution Compliance" section explicitly maps to all 5 constitutional principles:
    - Child Safety First: httpOnly cookies mentioned as security requirement
    - Context-Driven Architecture: No changes to React Context
    - Test-First Development: E2E tests required before implementation
    - Error Resilience: Graceful error handling specified
    - Docker-First Development: Container support required

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Technology-agnostic (no implementation leakage)
- Testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Properly scoped with documented assumptions and dependencies
- Aligned with project constitution

**No blockers identified**. Feature can proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.

## Notes

**Strength**: The specification excellently balances technical clarity with business focus. The Assumptions section provides crucial context (existing auth system, deployment environment) without prescribing implementation details.

**Recommendation**: During planning phase, ensure the routing solution maintains the technology-agnostic approach. Implementation plan should explore multiple options (e.g., reverse proxy, API gateway, BFF pattern) rather than jumping to a single solution.
