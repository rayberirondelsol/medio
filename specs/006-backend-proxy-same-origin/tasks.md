# Implementation Tasks: Same-Origin Authentication

**Feature**: 006-backend-proxy-same-origin
**Branch**: `006-backend-proxy-same-origin`
**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Constitution**: Test-First Development (Principle III) - NON-NEGOTIABLE

## Task Execution Order

Tasks MUST be executed in phase order (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3...). Within each phase:
- Tasks marked `[P]` can be executed in parallel
- Tasks without `[P]` must be executed sequentially
- All tests MUST be written before implementation (TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
