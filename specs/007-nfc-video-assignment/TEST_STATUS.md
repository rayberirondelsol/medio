# Test Status: 007-nfc-video-assignment

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: NFC Video Assignment
**Status**: ‚úÖ MVP Complete with Manual Testing

## E2E Tests Status

### Written Tests ‚úÖ
All E2E tests have been written and schema-corrected (8 tests total):

| Test ID | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| T009 | Open video assignment modal | ‚úÖ Written |
| T010 | Assign videos to chip | ‚úÖ Written |
| T011 | Validate max 50 videos | ‚úÖ Written |
| T012 | GET endpoint returns videos in sequence order | ‚úÖ Written |
| T013 | PUT endpoint batch updates | ‚úÖ Written |
| T014 | DELETE endpoint removes and re-sequences | ‚úÖ Written |
| BONUS | Prevent duplicate videos | ‚úÖ Written |
| BONUS | Validate contiguous sequences | ‚úÖ Written |

### Execution Status ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Blocked**: E2E tests cannot execute due to auth.setup.ts failures

**Root Cause**:
- Playwright configuration requires global setup tests to pass first
- `tests/auth.setup.ts` and `tests/integration/auth.setup.ts` are failing
- Error: "TimeoutError: page.waitForURL: Timeout 15000ms exceeded"
- Registration endpoint returning 40x/50x errors

**Impact**:
- NFC-specific tests (`nfc-video-assignment.spec.ts`) cannot run
- Tests have their own auth setup (`setupUserAndChip` function)
- Tests are independent of global auth setup

### Alternative: Manual Testing ‚úÖ

Since E2E automation is blocked, the feature has been **manually tested in production**:

#### Successful Manual Tests:
1. ‚úÖ **Video Assignment**:
   - Navigate to NFC Manager (/nfc)
   - Click "Manage Videos" button (üé¨ icon)
   - Modal opens successfully
   - Shows "X videos assigned" or "No videos assigned"

2. ‚úÖ **Add Videos from Library**:
   - Click "+ Add Videos from Library"
   - Video library loads with thumbnails
   - Select multiple videos via checkboxes
   - Click "Add X Videos"
   - Videos appear in assigned list with sequence numbers

3. ‚úÖ **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**:
   - Grab video by entire row
   - Drag to new position
   - Sequence numbers update automatically (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - Visual feedback during drag (.dragging class)

4. ‚úÖ **Remove Video**:
   - Click √ó button on video row
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - After confirmation: Video removed
   - Remaining videos re-sequenced automatically
   - **Toast notification**: "Video removed successfully" üéâ

5. ‚úÖ **Save Changes**:
   - Click "Save Changes" button
   - Loading state shows ("Saving...")
   - **Toast notification**: "Video assignments saved successfully" üéâ
   - Modal closes automatically
   - Chip card updates video count

6. ‚úÖ **Error Handling**:
   - Network failures show inline error messages
   - **Toast notifications** for all errors üéâ
   - ErrorBoundary catches crashes
   - AbortController cancels requests on modal close

7. ‚úÖ **Validation**:
   - Max 50 videos enforced (UI + backend)
   - No duplicate videos allowed
   - Contiguous sequences validated (1,2,3 not 1,3,5)

## Production Verification ‚úÖ

### Deployed Components:
- ‚úÖ Backend API: medio-backend.fly.dev
- ‚úÖ Frontend: medio-react-app.fly.dev
- ‚úÖ Database: sequence_order column migrated successfully
- ‚úÖ Toast Notifications: react-toastify integrated

### API Endpoints (Production Tested):
```bash
# GET videos for chip
curl https://medio-backend.fly.dev/api/nfc/chips/{id}/videos
‚úÖ Returns videos with sequence_order sorted

# PUT batch update assignments
curl -X PUT https://medio-backend.fly.dev/api/nfc/chips/{id}/videos \
  -d '{"videos": [{"video_id": "...", "sequence_order": 1}]}'
‚úÖ Validates max 50, contiguous sequences, no duplicates

# DELETE video and re-sequence
curl -X DELETE https://medio-backend.fly.dev/api/nfc/chips/{id}/videos/{videoId}
‚úÖ Removes video, re-sequences remaining (1,2,3)
```

### Database Schema (Production):
```sql
-- Verified via flyctl ssh console
SELECT * FROM video_nfc_mappings LIMIT 1;
-- Columns: id, nfc_chip_id, video_id, sequence_order, created_at, updated_at
-- ‚úÖ Correct production schema (id columns, not UUID variants)
```

## Test Coverage Assessment

### Automated Tests: ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked (8/8 written, 0/8 executed)
- E2E tests cannot run due to upstream auth setup failures
- Tests are schema-correct and ready for execution
- **Recommendation**: Fix global auth setup tests OR refactor NFC tests to be standalone

### Manual Tests: ‚úÖ Complete (7/7 scenarios passed)
- All user stories manually tested in production
- All API endpoints verified via curl
- All error scenarios tested
- Toast notifications confirmed working

### Overall Coverage: **Acceptable for MVP** ‚úÖ
- Feature is fully functional in production
- Manual testing confirms all requirements met
- Automated E2E tests are "insurance" for regression prevention
- Can be executed later once auth setup is fixed

## Recommendations

### Short Term (MVP):
1. ‚úÖ **DONE**: Feature is production-ready with manual verification
2. ‚úÖ **DONE**: Toast notifications enhance UX significantly
3. ‚úÖ **DONE**: All critical bugs fixed (schema, URL paths)

### Medium Term (Post-MVP):
1. **Fix Global Auth Setup** (`tests/auth.setup.ts`):
   - Debug registration endpoint failures
   - Increase timeout or fix redirect logic
   - Ensure auth cookies persist correctly

2. **Make NFC Tests Standalone**:
   - Remove dependency on global auth setup
   - Use built-in `setupUserAndChip` function exclusively
   - Add `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })` for cleanup

3. **Add to CI/CD**:
   - Once auth setup is fixed, add E2E tests to GitHub Actions
   - Run on every PR to prevent regressions
   - Generate test coverage reports

### Long Term (v1.1+):
1. **Unit Tests**: Add Jest tests for components and services
2. **Performance Tests**: Verify 500-video load time <1s with react-window
3. **Accessibility Tests**: Automated WCAG 2.1 validation
4. **Visual Regression Tests**: Screenshot comparison for UI changes

## Conclusion

**Feature 007-nfc-video-assignment is PRODUCTION-READY** ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ All user stories implemented and manually verified
- ‚úÖ Production deployment successful (zero downtime)
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications enhance user experience
- ‚úÖ Error handling robust (ErrorBoundary + AbortController)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è E2E automation blocked (non-critical, can be fixed post-MVP)

**Manual testing confirms MVP quality standards are met.**
