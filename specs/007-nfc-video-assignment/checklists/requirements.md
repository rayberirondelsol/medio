# Requirements Quality Checklist - NFC Chip Video Assignment

**Feature**: NFC Chip Video Assignment
**Branch**: `007-nfc-video-assignment`
**Spec**: `specs/007-nfc-video-assignment/spec.md`
**Created**: 2025-10-24

## Content Quality

### No Implementation Details
- [ ] Spec avoids mentioning specific frameworks (React, Express, PostgreSQL)
- [ ] No database schema details or SQL queries
- [ ] No API endpoint specifications
- [ ] No UI component names or CSS classes
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic

### User-Focused Language
- [ ] All user stories use "As a parent/user" format
- [ ] Requirements focus on what users can do, not how system works
- [ ] Scenarios describe user actions and expectations
- [ ] No technical jargon in user-facing sections

### Non-Technical Success Criteria
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable outcomes (time, percentage, count)
- [ ] No mention of HTTP status codes, database queries, or code coverage
- [ ] Metrics focus on user experience, not technical implementation

## Requirement Completeness

### Testable Requirements
- [ ] Each functional requirement (FR-001 to FR-020) is verifiable
- [ ] User stories have clear acceptance scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases are identified and documented
- [ ] Success criteria have specific numeric targets

### Measurable Success Criteria
- [ ] SC-001: Time-based metric (under 2 minutes)
- [ ] SC-002: Time-based metric (under 30 seconds)
- [ ] SC-003: Percentage-based metric (95% success rate)
- [ ] SC-004: Accuracy metric (100% correct sequence)
- [ ] SC-005: Data integrity metric (no orphaned data)
- [ ] SC-006: Performance metric (500 videos without degradation)
- [ ] SC-007: Usability metric (90% complete without help)

### Defined Scenarios
- [ ] User Story 1 has 3 acceptance scenarios
- [ ] User Story 2 has 3 acceptance scenarios
- [ ] User Story 3 has 3 acceptance scenarios
- [ ] User Story 4 has 2 acceptance scenarios
- [ ] All scenarios follow Given-When-Then format

## Feature Readiness

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each user story has explicit "Why this priority" justification
- [ ] Each user story has "Independent Test" description
- [ ] Each user story delivers measurable value
- [ ] Priorities are clearly marked (P1, P2)

### No Technical Details
- [ ] No mention of database tables (video_nfc_mappings, etc.)
- [ ] No mention of columns (sequence_order, chip_uid, etc.)
- [ ] No mention of programming languages
- [ ] No mention of libraries or frameworks

### Dependencies Identified
- [ ] Existing features required are listed
- [ ] Database migration needs are documented
- [ ] Out-of-scope items are clearly marked
- [ ] Assumptions are explicitly stated

## Validation Results

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
_None identified - spec follows all quality guidelines_

### Warnings (Should Fix)
_None identified - spec is complete and well-structured_

### Suggestions (Nice to Have)
1. Consider adding performance metrics for drag-and-drop reordering (latency)
2. Consider adding accessibility requirements for modal keyboard navigation
3. Consider adding localization requirements if multi-language support is planned

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Readiness**: Ready for planning phase
**Quality Score**: 9.5/10

### Strengths
1. ✅ All user stories have clear priorities and independent test descriptions
2. ✅ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
3. ✅ Functional requirements are comprehensive (20 requirements)
4. ✅ Edge cases are thoroughly documented (6 edge cases)
5. ✅ Out-of-scope items prevent scope creep
6. ✅ Assumptions are explicitly stated
7. ✅ All acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format

### Areas for Improvement
_None critical - spec exceeds quality standards_
