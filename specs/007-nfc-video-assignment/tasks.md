# Implementation Tasks: NFC Chip Video Assignment

**Feature**: 007-nfc-video-assignment
**Branch**: `007-nfc-video-assignment`
**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](./plan.md)

## Overview

This document provides an actionable task list for implementing the NFC Chip Video Assignment feature using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. Each user story is independently testable and can be delivered incrementally.

**Key Principles**:
- ✅ Tests written BEFORE implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- ✅ Each user story is independently testable
- ✅ MVP = User Story 1 + User Story 2 (assign + reorder videos)
- ✅ Constitution compliance enforced throughout

## Task Summary

| Phase | User Story | Task Count | Can Parallelize |
|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Phase 1: Setup | N/A | 8 tasks | 4 tasks |
| Phase 2: Foundational | N/A | 3 tasks | 0 tasks |
| Phase 3: US1 (Assign Videos) | P1 - Critical | 15 tasks | 8 tasks |
| Phase 4: US2 (Reorder Videos) | P1 - Critical | 8 tasks | 4 tasks |
| Phase 5: US3 (Remove Video) | P2 - Important | 5 tasks | 2 tasks |
| Phase 6: US4 (View Assignments) | P2 - Important | 3 tasks | 2 tasks |
| Phase 7: Polish | N/A | 6 tasks | 3 tasks |
| **TOTAL** | | **48 tasks** | **23 parallel** |

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Story Dependencies
```
Setup (Phase 1) → Foundational (Phase 2) → User Stories (Phase 3-6) → Polish (Phase 7)
                                              ├─ US1 (required for all others)
                                              ├─ US2 (depends on US1) ← MVP includes this!
                                              ├─ US3 (depends on US1)
                                              └─ US4 (depends on US1)
```

### MVP Scope (UPDATED)
**Minimum Viable Product**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4 (User Story 1 + 2)
- Parents can assign videos to chips ✅
- Parents can reorder videos via drag-and-drop ✅
- Videos save with correct sequence order ✅
- Assignments persist in database ✅
- **Estimated: 34 tasks, ~3-4 days**

**Rationale**: Reordering (US2) is critical for the feature value proposition. Without it, parents can't control playback sequence, which defeats the purpose of "ordered playlists."

### Incremental Delivery
1. **MVP Release**: US1 + US2 (assign + reorder videos) - 34 tasks
2. **v1.1**: US3 (remove videos) + US4 (view assignments) - +8 tasks
3. **v1.2**: Polish & optimization - +6 tasks

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
- **Backend**: `backend/src/routes/nfc.test.js`
  - GET endpoint: Returns videos in sequence order
  - PUT endpoint: Validates max 50 videos, contiguous sequences
  - DELETE endpoint: Re-sequences remaining videos
- **Frontend**: `src/components/nfc/__tests__/`
  - VideoAssignmentModal: Open/close, selection, save, error handling
  - AssignedVideosList: Drag-and-drop reordering, keyboard navigation

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- **File**: `tests/e2e/nfc-video-assignment.spec.ts`
  - US1: Assign 3 videos → Save → Refresh → Verify persistence
  - US2: Drag video to new position → Save → Verify sequence
  - US3: Remove video → Verify auto-re-sequencing
  - US4: Assign videos to 2 chips → Verify counts display

### Integration Tests
- Database migration runs successfully
- Rollback migration works without data loss
- Transaction rollback on validation failure
- Concurrent updates (last-write-wins behavior)

### Accessibility Tests (WCAG 2.1)
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys)
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management in modal
- Touch event support for mobile

### Performance Tests
- Modal loads 500 videos in <1 second
- Drag-and-drop latency <100ms
- Batch save operation <1s for 50 videos

## Implementation Notes

### TDD Workflow (Mandatory)
1. **RED**: Write E2E test for user story (should FAIL)
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimum code to make test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **REPEAT**: For each task in the story

### Constitution Compliance Checkpoints
- ✅ **T009-T011**: Tests written BEFORE implementation (Principle III)
- ✅ **T014**: Server-side validation enforced (Principle VI)
- ✅ **T019**: React Context API only, no Redux (Principle II)
- ✅ **T035-T036**: Error resilience with boundaries + AbortController (Principle IV)
- ✅ **T026b**: Accessibility (WCAG 2.1) verified (Principle IV)

### File Creation Order
1. Tests first (T009-T011, T015-T016, T021-T022, etc.)
2. Backend endpoints (T012-T014)
3. Frontend components (T017-T020)
4. Integration & polish (T035-T040)

| Migration fails on production | T004, T004c (verify locally + rollback) | Phase 1 |
| Drag-and-drop doesn't work on mobile | T026c (test touch events) | Phase 4 |
| Concurrent updates lose data | T013 (implement with transactions) | Phase 3 |
| Video library >500 items slow | T003b (react-window performance test) | Phase 1 |
| Accessibility issues | T026b (keyboard navigation verification) | Phase 4 |
| Migration can't be rolled back | T004b, T004c (rollback SQL + verification) | Phase 1 |

---

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Deploy to Staging**: `cd backend && flyctl deploy --app medio-backend-staging`
2. **User Acceptance Testing**: Share staging URL with product owner
3. **Production Deployment**: Follow `specs/006-backend-proxy-same-origin/DEPLOYMENT.md`
4. **Monitor**: Check Sentry for errors, Fly.io logs for performance
