# Specification Quality Checklist: Kids Mode Gesture Controls

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**:
- Spec successfully avoids mentioning React, TypeScript, or specific libraries
- Focus is on child experience and parent controls (user value)
- Language is accessible to non-technical parents and stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Resolution Complete**:
- **All clarifications resolved**: 3 questions answered with specific decisions:
  1. Profile selection: Always show selection screen (Option A)
  2. Parent exit: Hidden button sequence (Option A)
  3. Gesture sensitivity: Fixed system-wide defaults (Option A)

**Status**: All clarification markers removed. Specification ready for planning phase.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- 30 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-030) all have clear, testable acceptance criteria
- 6 user stories cover complete user journey from NFC scan to watch time enforcement
- 12 success criteria provide measurable validation metrics
- Spec maintains technology-agnostic language throughout

## Clarification Questions

The following questions require user input before the spec can be finalized:

### Question 1: Profile Selection Default Behavior

**Context**: "If multiple profiles exist, should Kids Mode remember the last selected profile or always show the selection screen?"

**What we need to know**: Should the system automatically select the last-used profile when Kids Mode loads, or should it always prompt for profile selection to ensure accuracy?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | Always show profile selection screen | Maximum accuracy - prevents wrong child's watch time being tracked. Adds 5-second delay at startup. Better for households where children share devices. |
| B      | Remember last selected profile | Faster startup (no selection step). Risk of tracking to wrong profile if device is shared. Requires parent or child to manually switch profiles when needed. |
| C      | Remember with timeout (reset after 1 hour) | Balances convenience and accuracy. Auto-resets if enough time has passed, but remembers during same session. Most flexible but adds complexity. |

**Your choice**: **Option A - Always show profile selection screen**

### Question 2: Parent Exit Mechanism

**Context**: "How should parents exit Kids Mode to return to parent mode?"

**What we need to know**: What method should be used to prevent children from accidentally or intentionally exiting Kids Mode to access parent controls?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | Hidden button sequence (e.g., tap corners in specific order) | No visible UI elements, maintains clean Kids Mode interface. Must be documented for parents. Risk of children discovering the sequence. |
| B      | PIN code entry | Most secure option. Requires on-screen keyboard which breaks button-free design. Parent must remember PIN. Standard security pattern. |
| C      | Time-based auto-exit (after 2 hours of inactivity) | Completely passive, no parent interaction needed. May exit unexpectedly during long video watching. Cannot exit on-demand. |
| D      | Physical device button (power button triple-press) | No on-screen UI needed. Uses device hardware. May conflict with device OS shortcuts. Requires documentation. |

**Your choice**: **Option A - Hidden button sequence**

---

### Question 3: Gesture Sensitivity Configuration

**Context**: "Should gesture sensitivity (tilt angle threshold, shake acceleration threshold) be configurable per profile or system-wide?"

**What we need to know**: Different children have different physical abilities and device handling patterns. Should sensitivity be customizable, and at what level?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | Fixed system-wide defaults (not configurable) | Simplest implementation. One-size-fits-all approach. May not work well for very young children (age 4-5) or children with motor skill differences. |
| B      | Configurable per profile | Maximum flexibility. Parents can tune sensitivity for each child's ability level. Adds configuration complexity in parent mode. Requires additional UI. |
| C      | Automatic adaptive sensitivity | System learns from child's gesture patterns over time and adjusts thresholds. Most user-friendly long-term. Complex to implement. Requires data collection and ML. Out of scope for MVP. |

**Your choice**: **Option A - Fixed system-wide defaults**

## Summary

**Overall Readiness**: ðŸŸ¢ **Ready for Planning**

**Status**:
- âœ… Content quality: Excellent
- âœ… Requirement completeness: Complete
- âœ… Feature readiness: Ready
- âœ… Clarifications: All 3 questions answered

**Decisions Made**:
- Q1: Option A (Always show profile selection) - safest for multi-child households
- Q2: Option A (Hidden button sequence) - maintains button-free design
- Q3: Option A (Fixed defaults) - defers complexity, can iterate based on user feedback

**Next Steps**:
1. âœ… Clarifications resolved
2. âœ… Spec.md updated with selected answers
3. âœ… Checklist validated (all items pass)
4. **Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase**

These decisions prioritize MVP simplicity and maintainability while ensuring core child safety and user experience requirements are met. Future iterations can add per-profile customization based on user testing feedback.
